# Privacy

Version 1.1 of the Privacy policy, as published on 12th October 2020.

My privacy policy is simple (and will stay that way). It describes how I, Niklas Jordan, collect, use, and share information in connection with your use of my websites.

This policy applies to my following websites & domains:
- niklasjordan.com
- e.niklasjordan.com
- www.niklasjordan.com
- agood.link

## Contact
Niklas Jordan
Gartenstraße 3
19053 Schwerin
Germany

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me at [hello@niklasjordan.com](mailto:hello@niklasjordan.com).

## In general

I do not track you. I try my best to minimise the data I gather. I use self-hosted free and open tools whenever possible and I do not share your data with third parties.

## Your rights
You always have the right to access all personal information I hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact me: [hello@niklasjordan.com](mailto:hello@niklasjordan.com).

You may always file a complaint with your national data protection authorities regarding the use of your data. But please tell me first so I have a chance to sort things out.

## Newsletter
I manage the newsletter using [Sendy →](https://sendy.co/), hosted on my own server on [Greenhost →](https://greenhost.net/).

When you sign up for my mailing list, I'm the only one who sees your email address. I will never share it with anyone else and I will use it to send you resources and updates about using tech for good until you unsubscribe.

## Secure Data Transfer
This website transmits all data using HTTPS, encrypting all data between the browser and the server. Your network provider may still be able to see that you are loading files from niklasjordan.com, but not their content.

## Analytics
I don't use any web analytics applications or server logs.
