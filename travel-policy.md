# Travel policy

I like to travel to conferences, meet new people and share my knowledge. But not at any price. I try to keep my carbon emissions as low as possible. That's why some rules apply to my travels:

1. I fly only **as a last resort**! But I love to travel by train.
2. **Remote conferencing** – such as Google Hangout or Skype – is always a good alternative.
3. **All travel must be carbon offset.** Offsetting is imperfect, but nevertheless, a useful short-term measure to [mitigate the impacts of travel](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/carbon-offsets.pdf). I use [Atmosfair](https://www.atmosfair.de/en/), which invests only in projects that meet the stringent [Gold Standard](https://www.goldstandard.org/our-work/what-we-do). I will not travel without an offset.
