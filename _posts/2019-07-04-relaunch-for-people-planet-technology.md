A few weeks ago, I sent a survey to all subscribers to my newsletter, [People, Planet & Technology](https://blog.niklasjordan.com/newsletter/), and many of them participated. I was really surprised by a large number of respondents. This really helped me to understand who is reading my newsletter and what interests them.

Here are a few results of that:

Especially the last question surprised me enormously, and at the same time, I feel honoured. I didn&#8217;t expect that, but it shows me that there seems to be an interest in the content that connects environmental issues with technology. I will focus this wayâ€¦

## What is going to change

Question two was probably the most helpful question of the survey. Here I asked you what you want to read in the editions and which topics inspire you the most.

Therefore I will focus on the next issues on exactly this content:

  * Best practices and examples of the use of technology for environmental protection
  * the ethical side in the use of technology

Besides, I will make some recommendation for persons you should follow and other stuff like podcasts, videos, etc.
