> During this webinar, we will analyse the explosion that occurred at the port of the city of Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, in August 2020 and we will employ RUS to learn how to assess the damage caused. We will focus on the use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 products to see how this explosion was captured from space. We will also show you how to access the RUS Service and how to download, process, analyse and visualize the free data acquired by the Copernicus satellites.
