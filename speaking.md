# I like to share.

I regularly give talks on different topics I care about. Some of these are:
- using tech for social and environmental good
- accessibility and inclusivity
- ethical use of technology
- the planet-friendly web
- UX & usability
- privacy

In addition to speaking at conferences, I sometimes coach companies and their staff privately. If you'd be interested in a workshop or lecture, let's talk!

All my slides and past/next events you can [find on noti.st â†’](https://noti.st/niklasjordan).
