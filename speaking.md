# I like to share.

I regularly give talks on topics I care about. Some of these are using tech for social and environmental good, tech ethics, or Earth observation stuff.

In addition to speaking at conferences, I sometimes coach companies and their staff privately. If you'd be interested in a workshop or lecture, let's talk!

Want to see a nice example? Here you can see a talk I gave at 36C3:
