# About this site

Do you think this site looks old-school, ugly or broken? I can calm you down: it's not broken! It consists exclusively of HTML and avoids graphic elements, exciting pictures, elaborate animations and JavaScript. Only text... Why is that so? Read on...

Did you know that the Internet is responsible for 830 million tons of CO2 per year? That's as much as the entire aviation industry emits. This is mainly due to extensive websites, large pictures and videos. The more complex a website is designed, the more data has to be transmitted, and the more energy is needed. And energy causes emissions.

Actually, it's quite simple:
**Data = Energy = CO2 emissions **

In the last ten years, the average website size has more than tripled. The curious thing is, however, that the actual content on the websites has become less. The massive increase in data is mainly due to videos, elaborate animations and many pictures.

A (link: https://speedcurve.com/blog/web-performance-page-bloat/ text: website today is about 3.5 MB →) in size: my website here needs only 7 KB. That means my website needs only 0.2 % of the data on an average website.

**Website sizes compared:**
<div style="background:#000; height: 20px; width: 350px; display: block; color: #fff; padding: 5px 0; margin-bottom:10px;">&nbsp;Average website size</div>
<div style="background:#000; height: 30px; width: 1px; display:inline-block;"></div> <div style="height: 20px; display: inline-block; padding: 5px 0;">← My website size :-)</div>

The cool thing is, I don't have to do without any content, and you can find out everything you need to know on this page. Just not so pretty ;-) 

What does this do for the environment?
Quite simple: My old website was 170 KB in size (already much smaller than the average websites on the internet) and [caused about 1 kg CO2 per month →](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/niklasjordan-com-about-me/). That's about as much as 37 balloons full of CO2. My new website, with a size of 7 KB, produces [just as much CO2 as fits in a balloon →](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/lite-niklasjordan-com-about/), per month. Not bad, right?

**CO2 emissions compared:**
<div style="background:#000; height: 20px; width: 370px; display: block; color: #fff; padding: 5px 0; margin-bottom:10px;">&nbsp;My old site</div>
<div style="background:#000; height: 30px; width: 10px; display:inline-block;"></div> <div style="height: 20px; display: inline-block; padding: 5px 0;">← My NEW website :-)</div>

I think against this background, you can quietly live without a bit of superfluous knickknacks like colors and videos, right.
